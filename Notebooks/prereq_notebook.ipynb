    "Greetings.  My name is James, but I prefer Jimmy.  This is my 4th pathway/workshop with Code:You.  I have previously competed the Software Development Pathway, Web Development Pathway, and the AWS DevOps/Cloud Computing pathway.  Ive learned python in the past, at KCTCS, but it has been a while since I have actually had to use it.  I own a game called \"The Farmer Was Replaced\" that you play using only python code but thats the most ive used Python sinse 2020. Jupiter notebooks etc are completely foreign to me. I took web dev before this hoping it will help me with the capstone project.  When I did software dev, I had to build a blazor/mudblazor frontend and I was terrible with the CSS/HTML so I wanted to take that class before this one.  "
